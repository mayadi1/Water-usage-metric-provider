# Water-usage-metric-provider
A smart tracker for water usage that provide metrics from just as little as a shower to as large as an entire city

STORY

The motivation behind the project came from the shortage of water and high costs of water bills in San Francisco. We started studying data about water usage in California Households. The average indoor gallon use per household per day in California is 174.31.

We all like to make a saving â€“ and one of the easiest ways to reduce your water bill is to apply for a meter.

You will be amazed how much water and money you can save by making a few small changes to your daily routine.

The purpose of this project is to collect the water used in a house or apartment while storing the usage in a database .

Our motto is ," A quarter of your energy bill comes from heating water. By saving a few litres each day, you can reduce your energy bills, your water bill (if on a meter) and help the environment. "
